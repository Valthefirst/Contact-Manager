# Contact Manager
This application allows you to easily manage your contacts by creating, editing, and deleting them. The contacts are stored in a database, so you can access them anytime you need to.

## How to install the database
Download the ``ContactManager.sql`` script and execute it in MS SQL Server Management Studio
